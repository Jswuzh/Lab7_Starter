Check your Understanding:
1:Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline?
With a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed, this ensure test run consitently on every push, catchin issues early in the development cycle. This prevents bugs from reaching production and enforce code quality

2.Would you use an end-to-end test to check if a function is returning the correct output?
No, end-to-end are verifying user workflows in the application are better suited for checking function outputs.
